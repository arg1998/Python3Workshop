    "+ ### Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability\n",
    "\n",
    "+ ### Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ ### Python can run equally on different platforms such as Windows, Linux, Unix and Macintosh etc. So, we can say that Python is a portable language.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ ### It implies that other languages such as C/C++ can be used to compile the code and thus it can be used further in our python code.\n",
